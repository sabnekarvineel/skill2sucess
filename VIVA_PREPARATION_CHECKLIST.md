## 🗣️ COMMUNICATION TIPS

### How to Answer Questions:
1. **Listen carefully** - Understand the full question
2. **Think briefly** - 3-5 seconds is okay
3. **Structure answer** - Start with overview, then details
4. **Use examples** - "For example..." makes it clearer
5. **Connect concepts** - Show how things relate
6. **Be concise** - 1-2 minutes per answer is good

---

### Example Answer Structure:
```
Question: "How does authentication work?"

Answer:
"Authentication in our application uses JWT tokens:

[Overview] First, the user registers or logs in through the frontend.

[Details] The password is hashed using bcrypt and stored in MongoDB. 
When they log in, we verify the password and generate a JWT token 
that contains the user ID and role.

[Connection] This token is then stored in the frontend's localStorage 
and included in all subsequent API requests in the Authorization header.

[Implementation] Our auth middleware verifies this token on the backend. 
If valid, we extract the user ID and allow the request. If invalid, 
we return a 401 error.

[Result] This provides secure, stateless authentication without 
needing session storage on the server."
```
