## 💡 How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

### Skill Matching Algorithm

**Step 1: Get User Skills**
```
User.skills = {
  programming: ["Python", "SQL"],
  databases: ["MySQL"],
  frameworks: ["Pandas"],
  tools: ["Excel", "Tableau"],
  softSkills: ["Problem Solving"]
}
```

**Step 2: Get Required Skills**
```
DataAnalyst.requiredSkills = {
  programming: ["Python", "SQL", "R"],
  databases: ["MySQL", "PostgreSQL", "MongoDB"],
  frameworks: ["Excel", "Tableau", "Power BI"],
  tools: ["Jupyter", "Git", "Google Analytics"]
}
```

**Step 3: Find Matches**
```
Flattened User: [Python, SQL, MySQL, Pandas, Excel, Tableau, Problem Solving]
Flattened Required: [Python, SQL, R, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Jupyter, Git, Google Analytics]

Matches: [Python, SQL, MySQL, Excel, Tableau] = 5 skills
Total Required: 12 skills
```

**Step 4: Calculate Score**
```
Score = (5 / 12) × 100 = 41.67%
Category = "Developing"
```

### Current Level Detection

```
if (totalSkills < 5) → Beginner
else if (totalSkills < 10) → Intermediate
else → Advanced
```

### Timeline Estimation

```
Base time by level:
- Beginner: 6 months base
- Intermediate: 4 months base
- Advanced: 2 months base

Adjusted by missing skills:
Adjustment = ceiling(missingSkills / 2)

Total = base + adjustment
```
